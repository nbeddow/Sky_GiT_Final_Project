Project Specifications
Throughout this project your team should utilise Agile practices. You should assign a Scrum Master for the duration of the project and plan the number and duration of your sprints. You must conduct rituals such as stand-ups, reviews and retrospectives.
Throughout the project you will showcase your weekly progress to your instructor during your 30-minute zoom sessions. You will discuss outcomes of your reviews and retrospectives with your instructor, including any action points identified during these rituals. Your instructor will act as both a technical advisor and product owner.
